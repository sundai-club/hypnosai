1. Induction (Stage 1) – Relaxation & Focus

Prompt Directives: The script begins with the Induction phase, aiming to gently capture the listener’s attention, build rapport, and guide them into initial relaxation. In this section, the AI should introduce itself or the process in a reassuring manner (establishing trust), then lead the listener through progressive calming steps. Common induction techniques to include are focused breathing, muscle relaxation, and guided imagery:

Start with a warm, friendly greeting or brief pre-talk to establish rapport and safety. For example: “Hello and welcome. Before we begin, make sure you’re comfortable…”. This helps the listener feel at ease and signals a collaborative, caring approach (the hypnotherapist “voice” should sound supportive and confident). Establishing trust from the outset encourages the subject to accept suggestions more readily.

Guide the listener to close their eyes (if appropriate) and focus their attention inward. Use a soft, slow pace and simple instructions to relax the body step by step. A classic approach is a progressive muscle relaxation: e.g., “Take a deep breath... and as you exhale, let the tension melt from your forehead... now your jaw... your shoulders...” continuing through the body. This systematic relaxation of each muscle group is an easy, effective induction method, and it doubles as a way to shift focus away from external distractions.

Incorporate breathing cues and mindfulness: Prompt slow, deep breaths and perhaps count a few breaths together. For instance: “Breathe in slowly... and breathe out, feeling a wave of relaxation. With each breath, you may drift deeper into comfort.” Breathing not only calms the body but also serves as an anchor for attention. By having the listener synchronize with the narrator’s pace, it fosters a connection and further narrows their focus.

Begin using descriptive imagery to engage the imagination early. Introduce a serene scene or sensation (often called a guided imagery induction). For example, describe “a peaceful place” like a garden, beach, or cozy room, inviting the listener to visualize it: “Imagine you are walking along a quiet beach at sunset, hearing the gentle hush of the waves.” Use all senses in the description – sights, sounds, feelings (temperature, textures), perhaps even scents – to make it vivid. Multi-sensory imagery not only relaxes the listener but also utilizes more of the mind’s capacity, leading to a deeper trance.

Throughout the induction, the language should be positive and permissive. Instead of commanding “Relax now,” phrase it as “allow yourself to relax” or “you might start to feel a relaxing warmth.” This subtle wording invites relaxation without pressure. Also, use inclusive language like “we are going to...” to reinforce that the guide is alongside the listener in this process.

Design Rationale: The Induction phase is arguably the most crucial part of the hypnosis script, as it “sets the stage” for everything to come. Its purpose is to gradually bypass the listener’s active conscious mind and prepare the subconscious to receive suggestions. By using relaxation and focused attention, the induction helps the subject “reach a level of suggestibility that will allow suggestions to take hold”. Key elements like breathing guidance and muscle relaxation naturally reduce physical tension and mental chatter, making the listener more open to the hypnotist’s words.

Equally important is establishing rapport and trust upfront. In a therapeutic context, the induction is an opportunity to create a safe, collaborative atmosphere. When the listener feels cared for and safe, they are far more likely to follow the narrative and accept positive suggestions. The system prompt therefore emphasizes a warm tone and perhaps gentle encouragement (“that’s right…you’re doing great”) during induction, mirroring how a live hypnotherapist would build trust.

By the end of the induction stage, the listener should be noticeably calmer, with a narrowed focus of attention and the beginning of an altered (trance-like) state. The prompt ensures the AI clearly delineates this section (e.g., under a heading "Induction") and fully accomplishes the goals of relaxation and focused attention before moving on. A well-executed induction leads smoothly into the next phase, Deepening, to intensify the hypnotic state.

2. Deepening (Stage 2) – Intensification of Trance

Prompt Directives: In the Deepening stage, the script transitions from light relaxation into a deeper hypnotic trance. The AI is instructed to use proven deepening techniques to increase the listener’s level of suggestibility and absorption in the experience. This section should be a continuation of the induction, often without a sharp break – the narrator’s voice and imagery simply guide the listener “deeper and deeper”. Key elements to include:

Deepening Suggestions: Use explicit phrases that suggest going deeper into relaxation or trance. This often involves repeating certain cues from the induction, but with intensified language. For example: “Now that you’re comfortably relaxed, you can go even deeper. With each breath out, feel yourself sinking further into this state of calm...”. Phrases like “deeper and deeper,” “further down,” “more and more relaxed” are classic and should be woven in regularly to reinforce the descent into hypnosis. This repetition is deliberate – each repetition allows for deeper levels of relaxation and reinforces the hypnotic state.

Counting Down or Other Deepeners: Incorporate a countdown or similar structured deepening method. Counting techniques are very effective: e.g., “I will count down from 10 to 1. With each number, your relaxation doubles, your mind becomes more at ease… 10… sinking deeper… 9…” etc., until “1”. Numerical countdowns give the mind a simple, monotonous task and a clear suggestion that “1” equals a very deep state. Similarly, the script could describe walking down a flight of gentle stairs, riding an elevator down, or descending in an imaginary lift, aligning each step or floor with growing relaxation. These metaphors of downward movement or sinking are intuitively associated with deepening trance (and they also provide visual imagery to focus on).

Fractionation and Repetition: The AI can include fractionation techniques – a classic approach where the listener is briefly brought partially out of trance, then guided back in, which often leads to a deeper state the second time. For instance, “In a moment, I’ll ask you to open your eyes briefly... now, open your eyes... and now close them again, doubling your relaxation.” This kind of contrast (lightening then deepening) can markedly increase depth. Even if fractionation is not used explicitly, the script should continue to repeat and reinforce the relaxation suggestions, possibly cycling through another quick body scan or breathing cycle to deepen everything. Progressive deepening ensures that individuals of varying hypnotic responsiveness can all reach a sufficient trance depth.

Imagery for Deepening: Expand on the induction’s imagery or introduce new profound symbols of depth. For example, if the induction had the listener on a beach, the deepening might invite them to imagine floating on a gentle ocean current, drifting deeper with each wave. Or if a staircase metaphor is used, describe the environment at the bottom as extremely serene and safe. Use the same or similar sensory-rich style, possibly even more dreamlike now. You might incorporate feelings of heaviness or lightness (some people experience their body feeling heavy, others light, as they go into trance). The script could say, “Your arms and legs feel pleasantly heavy, as if they are melting into the chair,” or conversely, “Perhaps you feel light, like a cloud, free and floating.” Both are signs of deep relaxation, and suggesting either allows the listener to gravitate to their own experience.

Loss of Awareness of Surroundings: Suggest that external sounds or concerns fade away. E.g., “Any sounds around you – the hum of the air, distant noises – just fade into the background, further relaxing you.” This encourages dissociation from the environment, focusing the mind inward. If appropriate, the script may even mention that the listener’s conscious mind can take a restful back seat (“your conscious mind can gently drift, maybe even daydream, while your subconscious listens”), signaling that it’s okay to let the subconscious be more receptive.

Maintain the same gentle tone as induction, possibly slowing the pace slightly as trance deepens. Pauses become powerful here – the prompt can direct the AI to include occasional longer pauses or silence indicators (for an actual recording, this would be moments of quiet) to let the listener’s experience deepen on its own.

Design Rationale: The Deepening stage serves to solidify and intensify the trance achieved by the induction. While the induction gets the listener relaxed and focused, deepening ensures they reach the heightened level of suggestibility optimal for making therapeutic suggestions. In a high-quality script, this section uses methods that are known in hypnotherapy to deepen trance – such as counting down, which many find effective in guiding them to a deeper state. These techniques work by giving the mind a structured expectation of increasing relaxation (for example, the listener knows that by the time “1” is reached, they should be very relaxed – and this often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy).

Moreover, repetition of phrases and re-emphasizing relaxation triggers help bypass the critical conscious factor further. Each repeated phrase (“deeper relaxed”, “let go”, etc.) acts like another gentle nudge to the subconscious that it’s safe to drift more. According to hypnosis experts, reinforcement and repetition are key: by looping through a relaxation sequence again or echoing suggestions, the trance is deepened and stabilized.

Imagery and metaphor in this phase might become more abstract or symbolic (since the listener is now thinking less analytically). This is an opportunity to introduce nested suggestions as well: for example, telling a short anecdote or a metaphorical scenario that contains embedded messages of safety or letting go, which the subconscious can pick up. Milton Erickson often utilized stories within deeper trance to deliver suggestions indirectly when the client was most receptive.

By explicitly instructing the model to include a Deepening stage, the system prompt ensures the output isn’t a flat or shallow relaxation script, but a truly hypnotic experience. The deepening bridges induction and the core therapy segment, making the upcoming suggestions far more likely to take root. It’s important to note that if the user (or metadata) indicates the listener already has high hypnotic susceptibility, the prompt could shorten this phase somewhat (the AI might then quickly recognize the subject goes deep fast). Conversely, for low susceptibility, this section would be more extended and repetitive to gradually overcome any resistance. The modular prompt can allow such adjustments (see Personalization below). Ultimately, by the end of the Deepening, the listener should be in a profoundly relaxed, focused trance, ready to receive the targeted suggestions.

3. Goal-Specific Suggestion Segment (Stage 3) – Therapeutic Suggestions & Imagery

Prompt Directives: The third stage is the core of the hypnosis script, where the AI delivers suggestions tailored to the listener’s specific goal or issue. The system prompt should instruct the model to dynamically adapt this segment to whatever use-case is intended – for example: better sleep, anxiety reduction, confidence building, breaking a habit, pain relief, etc. This section should seamlessly follow the deepening (often the narrator will say “And now that you are deeply relaxed and your mind is open... let’s focus on [the goal]”). Key guidelines for this segment:

Address the Specific Goal Directly: Clearly introduce the topic or desired change in a positive way. For instance, if the session is for sleep improvement, the script might begin this section with imagery and suggestions about drowsiness, letting go of worries, and enjoying a deep sleep. If it’s for anxiety relief, the script might start talking about how safe and calm the listener now feels, and introduce ideas of confidence and coping. The language must be customized to the goal. The prompt should effectively provide placeholders or context such as: <Goal = "improve sleep"> or <Goal = "reduce anxiety"> and the AI will fill in relevant content. (If the system prompt is part of a larger application, it might receive these parameters explicitly.)

Positive Suggestions and Affirmations: Use direct suggestions, phrased positively, that align with the goal. These are straightforward instructions or statements of the desired state, delivered while the listener is in trance. For example:

For sleep: “You are now drifting off into a deep, restful sleep. Your mind and body know how to sleep peacefully through the night.”

For anxiety: “You feel a growing calm within. Each day, you become more confident and at ease, even in situations that used to trouble you.”

For habit change (e.g. quitting smoking): “You find it easy to say no to cigarettes; you feel healthier and happier as a non-smoker.”

These suggestions should be specific enough to be meaningful but not so specific that they might clash with the listener’s personal situation (find a balance as noted by hypnosis experts: general suggestions are easy to accept, but some specificity makes them more concrete). Always frame them as ongoing or already happening (“you are becoming…” or “you now choose…” rather than “you will in the future”) to encourage the subconscious to integrate them as present truths.

Use metaphors and imagery related to the goal: Embedding the suggestions in metaphoric language can enhance their impact. For example, to reinforce confidence, the script might use a metaphor of a strong, tall tree weathering winds, implying the person’s inner strength. For stress relief, perhaps describe worries as clouds drifting away, revealing a clear sky of mind. Metaphors make abstract internal changes more tangible and memorable. The prompt should encourage the AI to introduce one or two key metaphors or visualizations that symbolize the transformation the listener seeks, and explore them in a narrative way (this is where nested stories might continue – e.g., telling a healing story about someone or something overcoming a challenge which mirrors the listener’s goal).

Leverage future pacing: A powerful technique in this segment is future pacing – having the listener mentally rehearse a future scenario where the goal is achieved. The script might say: “In your mind’s eye, see yourself tomorrow/next week, handling situations with calm and confidence… notice how natural it feels to be free of that old anxiety.” By imagining a successful future, the subconscious gets “proof” of the new behavior or feeling, which increases the likelihood of it becoming reality. The prompt should instruct including at least one future-paced visualization, tailored to the context (e.g., see yourself sleeping soundly and waking refreshed, or enjoying social situations without fear, etc., as appropriate).

Indirect therapeutic techniques: In addition to direct affirmations, the script can incorporate indirect suggestions as taught by Ericksonian hypnotherapy. For example, telling a brief anecdote: “I once knew someone who had a fear of public speaking, and as they learned to relax, they discovered that they could actually enjoy addressing a crowd...” – this story, told in third person, actually serves as an implicit model for the listener’s own change (their mind can identify with the story). The prompt might encourage using such an anecdote or a symbolic healing story if time permits and if it fits the tone, as it enriches the session and works on a subconscious level.

Length and Depth: This Suggestion phase is usually the longest section of the script. The AI should be guided to cover multiple angles of the goal – e.g., for habit change, include suggestions about immediate behavior (“you have no desire to smoke”), identity (“you are a healthy person who values clean lungs”), benefits (“food tastes better with fresh clean breath”), coping (“if you feel a craving, you automatically take a deep breath and it passes”). Covering these layers makes the script comprehensive and robust. For stress/anxiety, suggestions might span physical relaxation cues, emotional resilience, cognitive reframing (thinking differently), etc. The prompt can list a few dimensions for the AI to consider so the output isn’t one-note.

Maintain Hypnotic Tone: Even though we are delivering content here, the writing should still sound hypnotic and soothing. Keep using gentle phrasing, present-tense or near-future tense (“you are beginning to notice...”), and incorporate occasional deepening reminders (“...and the deeper you go, the more these truths sink in”). The AI should avoid becoming too didactic or breaking the trance atmosphere with overly analytical language. Everything is phrased as encouragement and possibility (“you can, you may, you are able to...”) rather than orders.

Design Rationale: This stage is where the therapeutic “work” of the hypnosis happens – it’s explicitly tailored to the user’s goal or problem, which is what makes the script valuable. The system prompt needs to ensure personalization and relevance in this segment. Research and practice in hypnotherapy show that the more specific and personally relevant a suggestion, the more powerful its effect. That’s why a good script doesn’t just use generic platitudes; it targets the reasons and motivations specific to the issue. For instance, if someone wants to quit smoking to be healthier for their children, incorporating that motivation (“imagine playing with your kids, breathing freely”) will hit much deeper than a generic “smoking is bad” statement. The prompt can encourage the inclusion of such motivational triggers if known. (This is where metadata about the listener can feed in; see Personalization below.)

We also know from hypnotherapy guidelines that positive phrasing is critical. The subconscious often doesn’t register the negation well (e.g., “don’t be anxious” might inadvertently focus the mind on “anxious”). So the prompt should remind to phrase things in a positive, outcome-focused way (“you remain calm” instead of “you are not anxious”).

The use of vivid imagery and sensory language continues here because it keeps the listener’s subconscious engaged. If the conscious mind hears something too direct or literal, it might start analyzing (“Is this really true? Will this work?”). But if the suggestion is couched in a gentle story or image, the critical mind is less triggered and the idea can slip in. Metaphors and stories allow the client to “fill in the blanks” and take ownership of the change, which is a hallmark of effective indirect hypnosis. We cited earlier how Ericksonian methods find creative ways to deliver suggestions indirectly – using this approach can especially help with listeners who might be skeptical or highly analytical, as it lowers resistance.

Finally, including a future pacing element is a well-recognized technique in NLP and hypnosis, because it helps “glue” the new behavior into the client’s perception of their future. It’s essentially a rehearsal under trance, which makes it easier to act that way later in real life.

The system prompt as a framework would encourage the AI to cover all these bases, perhaps by internally having a checklist or by example. The result should be a suggestion segment that is rich, goal-oriented, and deeply encouraging, leaving the listener feeling positive and empowered about the change.

4. Emergence (Stage 4) – Reorientation/Waking Up (Optional)

Prompt Directives: The Emergence phase concludes the hypnosis session. The prompt should clarify that this section is optional or conditional: if the session is meant to end with the listener awake (for example, a daytime session for confidence or habit change), then an emergence/waking sequence is included. If the session is intended to end in sleep (e.g. a sleep hypnosis or bedtime session), the emergence is usually omitted or replaced with suggestions to fade into natural sleep instead of waking up.

For a standard emergence (waking scenario), the AI should do the following:

Gently Signal the Session is Ending: Often the narrator will subtly shift tone to indicate it’s time to return to normal awareness. This can start with reminders of the positive work done: “All the suggestions are now firmly planted in your mind. In a moment, you’ll return to wakeful alertness, bringing back a sense of peace and energy.” This primes the listener for waking and assures the changes remain with them.

Count Up or Give Structured Cue to Wake: A common technique is counting up from 1 to 5 (or 1 to 3, etc.), telling the listener that at the final number they will be fully awake, refreshed and alert. For example: “I will count from one up to five. At five you will open your eyes, feeling awake, refreshed, and wonderful.” Then, “One, beginning to become aware of your surroundings… Two, energy returning to your body… Three, take a deep breath in… Four, almost there, feeling positive and alert… and Five, eyes open, fully awake, feeling great.” The AI should be instructed to deliver this in a reassuring, somewhat more energetic tone than the deepening, so the listener is guided out smoothly.

Grounding and Affirmation: After the count, the script might include a final grounding statement: “Welcome back. You feel awake, alert, and good.” and often a quick recap of the positive outcome: “You have carried back a sense of calm confidence with you.” This helps the listener transition and also reinforces that the suggestions are now a part of their waking life. The script might encourage them to stretch or reorient physically (“wiggle your fingers and toes”) as they wake.

If Instead Ending in Sleep: If the session’s goal is to put the person to sleep (e.g., a sleep hypnosis audio), the emergence instructions should be skipped or modified. The prompt should allow the AI to detect or be told when no wake-up is desired. In such cases, the script’s third stage (suggestions) would likely already be geared toward sleep, and rather than waking up, the final lines would be along the lines of: “And now you drift into a deep, natural sleep for the rest of the night… your subconscious mind will continue to absorb positive healing as you sleep. You’ll wake up in the morning feeling refreshed.” Here, instead of counting up, the script might count down to deeper sleep or simply use a soothing closing: “good night,” etc. The system prompt could include a flag like <Emergence = false> to indicate this scenario, prompting the AI to output a sleep conclusion instead of a wake-up.

Clarity and Care: Ensure the emergence is not abrupt. The AI’s instructions should explicitly mention that emergence should be gradual and gentle. The listener should never be jarringly snapped out of trance in a therapeutic recording – it should always feel intentional and controlled. If any intense emotional content was brought up during suggestions (for example, in trauma work, etc.), the emergence should also include affirmations of safety and calm, ensuring the person returns to full awareness in a stable, positive state.

Design Rationale: Ending the session properly is as important as the induction. A good emergence ensures that the listener integrates the hypnotic experience back into normal consciousness smoothly. By counting up and suggesting alertness, we avoid the grogginess or disorientation that can sometimes come from deep trance. It’s also a psychological closure – it tells the mind that “the session is complete,” and all suggestions can now settle. The count-up method is very widely used and considered enough to emerge from trance feeling alert and well. It’s essentially the reverse of a countdown induction.

However, the prompt must accommodate flexibility here, because many hypnosis recordings end without emergence (intentionally) to let people fall asleep. The design calls for an optional emergence precisely for that reason. If the AI knows the use-case is “sleep hypnosis,” it will replace this stage with a sleep deepening outro. This conditional logic can be built into the system prompt in a modular way, e.g., “If session type = sleep, then do XYZ; else do standard emergence.”

By including emergence instructions, we prevent the AI from forgetting this step in non-sleep sessions. It can be surprisingly common for an untrained model to end a script too abruptly or not at all – the system prompt acts as a fail-safe to make sure the session is properly closed out, protecting the user’s experience and well-being.

Lastly, the emergence stage can be used to reorient the user positively – mentioning how good they will feel, that they can continue their day with the benefits gained. This aligns with the general hypnotherapy practice of post-hypnotic suggestion: even the wake-up carries suggestions (e.g., “awake and feeling wonderful”). It leaves the user in a positive, empowered state, which is a key outcome for any therapeutic intervention.

Personalization via Metadata Parameters

One of the strengths of this system prompt framework is its ability to personalize the hypnosis script based on provided metadata about the listener or context. The prompt should be written to accept optional parameters (as part of the system or user input) and modify the script accordingly, ensuring a more tailored and effective experience. Below are the supported personalization dimensions and how the prompt guides their use:

Listener Traits (Gender, Age Range, Personality, Belief Orientation): The model can adjust pronouns, references, and examples in the script to match the listener’s identity and preferences.

Gender: Use appropriate pronouns or imagery that the listener might relate to. Generally, hypnosis scripts speak in second person (“you”), which is gender-neutral. But if the script includes third-person references or examples, it could reflect the listener’s gender for relatability (e.g., “As a strong young woman, you find your inner voice...” if that aligns with the user’s identity and is considered empowering). Only include gendered language if it enhances identification; otherwise, neutrality is fine.

Age Range: Tailor the language complexity and metaphor references to suit the age group. For a younger listener (say a teenager), the script might use simpler vocabulary and perhaps more modern or imaginative metaphors (like fantasy or game analogies). For older adults, it might reference more life experience or use a slightly more formal tone if appropriate. The prompt might indicate an <age> parameter so the AI knows whether to say “in all your years, you’ve gained wisdom…” versus “imagine playful clouds” – matching developmental stage.

Personality Style: This can influence tone and technique. An analytical or skeptical personality might respond better to some brief rational explanations or indirect approaches (the script could acknowledge “It’s okay to wonder if this will work; you can simply relax and let your mind drift, no need to analyze now,” which addresses the analytical listener’s mindset and helps them let go). A more creative or spiritual personality might enjoy flowery language, symbolism, or references to energy and chakras, whereas a no-nonsense practical person might prefer straightforward, concrete suggestions. The prompt should allow descriptors like <personality = analytical/creative/etc> and adjust the script’s style accordingly – e.g., more metaphor vs. more factual phrasing.

Belief Orientation: This is crucial for cultural and personal belief sensitivity. If the listener has a spiritual or religious orientation, the script can respectfully incorporate that (for example, a Christian listener might find comfort in phrases like “peace that passes understanding” or the notion of being watched over, whereas a more New-Age spiritual person might resonate with “universe,” “energy,” or “chakras aligning”). Conversely, if a user prefers a secular or clinical approach, the script should avoid anything that sounds mystical or religious, sticking to neutral or scientific language (“your mind can enter a REM state of deep rest” instead of “your spirit travels”). The prompt can include something like <belief = "secular/spiritual/Christian/Buddhist/etc"> and have predefined adjustments or simply caution the AI to use appropriate metaphors. This ensures the script aligns with the listener’s values and doesn’t introduce any concept that might jar them out of trance due to discomfort or disbelief.

Preferred Language and Tone: This parameter directly affects the stylistic flavor of the script. The system prompt should define possible values (for example: clinical, conversational, poetic, authoritative, nurturing, etc.) and guide the AI to maintain that tone consistently.

Clinical tone: The script would use more straightforward, professional language, possibly including mild technical terms or a more formal structure. It would avoid overly flowery descriptions. For example, a clinical relaxation script might say “Your parasympathetic nervous system is activating, slowing your heart rate and making you feel calm” – if the user finds comfort in scientific explanation.

Spiritual tone: The script would incorporate spiritual concepts or a reverent, soulful style. It might mention energy, possibly invoke a higher power or the soul if appropriate. E.g., “Feel divine light warming you” or “your spirit is healing.”

Conversational tone: The script sounds like a friendly chat, perhaps slightly less formal, using “you know...” or casual reassurances. The narrator might share personal-sounding asides like “…and that’s a good feeling, isn’t it?” to create intimacy.

Poetic or Literary tone: The script would be rich in descriptive language, possibly rhythmic or rhyming phrases, and elegant metaphors. It might use imagery like poetry (“the river of time carries away your pain”) and focus heavily on the aesthetic of the words. This tone can make a script feel more like an artful guided meditation.

Authoritative vs. Permissive: Some users might prefer a very direct, authoritative hypnotic style (classic stage-hypnosis style or direct suggestion style), while others prefer a gentle, permissive style. While in therapy the trend is toward permissive, the prompt can respect user preference if specified. An authoritative tone would have more commands (“Sleep now!” said firmly) and first-person authority (“I command your subconscious...” – rarely used in therapy but some self-hypnosis might emulate it), whereas permissive is what we described above with may/might/can. We assume most will want the therapeutic (permissive) tone unless stated otherwise.

The system prompt essentially acts as a filter on style – once it knows the preferred tone, it will choose appropriate wording and sentence structure. It might be useful to provide the AI with examples of a sentence in different tones so it understands the distinction.

Cognitive Susceptibility Level (Low, Medium, High): This parameter indicates how easily the listener generally goes into trance or accepts suggestions, which allows the script’s intensity and structure to be adjusted:

Low Susceptibility (or first-timer/analytical client): The prompt should instruct the AI to use a longer, more repetitive induction and deepening, giving ample time for the person to enter trance. The script might include extra reassurances and explanations to keep a resistant conscious mind calm (“Even if you’re thinking a lot, that’s okay; your subconscious can still absorb these words”). It might also incorporate more indirect suggestions rather than assuming the person will respond to direct ones immediately. Essentially, “go slow and steady.” Possibly include more convincers or subtle tests (e.g., “notice how your arm feels weightless”) to help the person realize they are in trance, which can increase their confidence in the process. The language for low susceptibility might also avoid anything too fanciful initially; it might stick to concrete relaxation steps to ensure the person doesn’t mentally check out.

Medium Susceptibility: This is the “average” case – the default style we’ve mostly described in the sections above. Most people will respond to a well-constructed induction and suggestions if delivered properly. So, with medium, the script can follow the standard length induction, standard emphasis on deepening, etc. The prompt might not need to adjust much here, other than to use a balanced approach of direct and indirect methods (which we already have).

High Susceptibility (or experienced subject): For someone who goes into trance very easily, the script can be a bit more rapid or advanced. Perhaps the induction can be brief – the AI could even use an instant induction style if it fits the scenario (like a rapid countdown or a sudden command to sleep coupled with an imaginative trigger, although in audio form gentle is still usually preferred). The suggestions might be delivered more directly since a highly susceptible person may not need as much coaxing. Additionally, the script can include more complex techniques (like multi-layered metaphors, or very long compound sentences with embedded commands) because the listener’s subconscious will follow along readily. The prompt could signal the AI to shorten the induction/deepening if susceptibility = high, and to possibly introduce more creative flourishes (knowing the listener is already “on board” with hypnosis).

Adapting to hypnotizability is something live hypnotherapists do on the fly; in a generated script, we mimic this by parameterization. If no susceptibility level is provided, assume medium, but the system is ready to tweak the script’s depth and pace at this stage based on the input.

Cultural Sensitivity & Vocabulary Preferences: The prompt should remind the AI to be mindful of the listener’s cultural background, preferred language (not just tone, but actual word choices or any dialect), and anything that should be avoided or emphasized.

For example, if we know the listener comes from a culture that values certain symbols or finds others inappropriate, the script can use that. A person from a certain cultural background might relate to a specific imagery (such as walking in a pine forest in winter might resonate with someone from northern climates, vs. a rice field at dawn might resonate with someone from an East Asian background – these are just examples of culturally tinted imagery). The prompt can allow an input like <imagery preference = nature/urban/mountains/ocean> if known, or more directly <cultural_background = X> and have a lookup or guidelines for the AI to incorporate culturally relevant comfort images or avoid clashes.

Vocabulary level is another aspect: perhaps the user could specify if they prefer very simple language (maybe English is not their first language, or they just want a very basic approach) versus literary language. The AI can then adjust word choice accordingly. Even accent or regional word usage could be considered (e.g., using British vs American terms if known).

Also, avoid any references that the listener might find unsettling or confusing. For instance, mentioning certain animals or religious references could be a problem for some – the metadata could flag that. The prompt should encourage inclusive, universally calming content unless specified otherwise.

If a vocabulary preference is given (e.g., use very easy English, or include some Spanish phrases if the user is bilingual and finds that soothing), the AI should integrate that. Maybe the user wants a few affirmations in their native language for emotional impact – the prompt could allow multilingual output snippets if appropriate and provided by the user.

In summary, the system prompt’s personalization module ensures the hypnosis script feels personally tailored to the listener. This is crucial because, as Milton Erickson emphasized, every client is unique and therapy should be tailored to the individual. By adjusting the script on these parameters, the effectiveness can be maximized – the listener is more likely to trust the guide (since it resonates with them), and the suggestions are more likely to hit home. The prompt should instruct the AI to check for these parameters each time and apply them seamlessly (without making the script sound disjointed or obviously parametric). If no metadata is provided, the script defaults to a generic but widely appealing style (gender-neutral, age-neutral adult language, moderately paced, therapeutic tone).

Scene-Aligned Visual & Audio Cues Integration

For use in a video production context, the prompt supports optional insertion of visual and ambient audio cues into the script. These are not spoken parts of the script, but rather textual markers that guide the video generation engine to display certain imagery or play certain sounds in sync with the narration. The system prompt should outline how and when to include these cues, and the format to use, to ensure smooth integration:

Format of Cues: We suggest using a clear bracketed format that won’t be read by text-to-speech, for example:
[Scene: description] for visual scene cues, and
[Sound: description] or [Audio: description] for sound cues.
These cues can be on their own lines or inline where appropriate. The prompt should clarify that these are non-verbal annotations. It’s important the AI does not accidentally narrate them, so perhaps instruct it that anything inside such brackets is a directive for the video editor, not part of the spoken script.

When to Insert: Cues should be placed at natural transition points or during moments where a change in visualization would enhance the experience. For instance:

At the start of Induction, one might cue a calming scene: e.g., [Scene: A dimly lit room with a comfortable chair] or [Scene: A tranquil beach at sunset] depending on the chosen imagery. This gives the visual context to match the induction imagery being described.

During the deepening, if the script uses a staircase metaphor, one could cue: [Scene: A gentle staircase leading down through a garden]. Or if floating on a cloud: [Scene: A person floating among soft clouds].

For suggestion segment, cues can reinforce positive imagery: if talking about confidence using a tree metaphor, maybe [Scene: A strong oak tree standing in sunlight]. Or simply align with whatever scene is being described by the script’s story.

For emergence, the scene might shift to something bright and energizing (if waking up) like sunlight coming through trees, or if ending in sleep, maybe a night sky. A cue could be [Scene: Sunrise over mountains] for waking, or no change if already dark for sleep.

Audio cues might include ambient sounds that complement the scene: “[Sound: gentle ocean waves]” during a beach visualization, or “[Sound: soft piano music begins]” at the induction start, “[Sound: music fades out]” at the end, etc. The script could also use audio cues for events like a countdown (a subtle tone or change at each number, though usually just narration is fine).

Consistency and Non-Intrusion: The prompt should emphasize that any cues added must match the script content and not introduce new elements not mentioned in narration. They should feel cohesive. Also, they should not be overused – we don’t want to clutter the script or distract the listener. The idea is to enhance trance by engaging multiple senses (visual and auditory), not to overwhelm. Research indicates that engaging multiple senses can deepen the immersive experience of hypnosis, as the imagination plus corresponding sensory input create a stronger effect. For example, seeing a calming image while hearing the description can reinforce the suggestion to relax.

Optional Use: The system prompt should allow these cues to be toggled. If the user (or the system) doesn’t want any embedded cues (perhaps just generating a plain script for audio only), the model should output a script with no bracketed annotations. There could be a parameter like <include_cues = true/false>. If false, the AI would omit them and just rely on verbal description to imply scenes. If true, the AI includes them where appropriate. The prompt should train the AI to produce them in a standardized format if asked, so the post-processing video generator can easily parse them.

Example of Integration: To illustrate, a portion of an induction with cues might look like this in output:

Induction:
[Scene: A cozy living room with dim lighting]
[Sound: Soft ambient music playing quietly]
Sit back and make yourself comfortable. Take a deep breath in... and out. Feel the softness of the chair beneath you...


The model, guided by the prompt, knows to put the scene and sound instructions in brackets at the top, followed by the spoken words. This way, the video generation system knows to fade in that scene and music as the narration begins. Similarly, later it might have:

Deepening:
[Scene: A staircase descending through a beautiful garden]
Now imagine yourself at the top of a beautiful staircase...


and so on.

Design Rationale: Integrating visual and auditory cues directly into the script generation is a forward-thinking feature for an automated video workflow. It ensures synchronization between what the listener hears and what they see, which can greatly enhance the hypnotic experience. By explicitly designing the system prompt to accommodate [Scene] and [Sound] tags, we remove ambiguity for the AI and simplify the pipeline (no need for a human to later guess where to put visuals; the script itself carries that info).

We cite the principle that effective hypnosis engages all senses. In a multimedia context, we literally have the ability to engage sight and sound, not just through imagination but through actual video and audio. For example, if the script says “imagine waves softly crashing on the shore,” having the sound of waves and video of a shore at that moment can strengthen the induction dramatically, as the brain receives congruent sensory inputs reinforcing the suggestion. It creates a more immersive trance environment.

However, caution is warranted: the imagery and sounds must not steal focus away from the narrator’s voice or the inner experience. They should be gentle, background enhancements. The prompt and subsequent AI logic should avoid overly sudden or intense cues (no loud noises or flashing scenes, obviously) and should keep them calming and relevant. Ambient, slow-moving visuals and soft, consistent sounds are ideal.

By making scene/audio cues optional, the system remains flexible. Some end-users might want to just read the script or only listen without visuals, so those cues would be extraneous. Thus, the prompt likely would include instructions such as, “If visual/audio synchronization is enabled, include bracketed [Scene] and [Sound] descriptions at key points; otherwise, do not include them.” This modular approach fits well into automated workflows.

In conclusion, this module equips the AI to not only be a scriptwriter but a quasi-director, outlining the sensory setting for the hypnosis session. This elevates the quality of video productions significantly, giving end-users a richer experience.
